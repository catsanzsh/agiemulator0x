# 🔥 agiemulator0x - The AGI Emulator Framework (Flame64 Sub-Core)

**"Booting the future of emulation through AI, lore, and logic."**

Welcome to **agiemulator0x**, a high-concept, AI-assisted emulator core project designed for experimental and modular development. This project is part of the broader **Flame64 Ultra Core** system, with inspiration from legacy emulators like Project64, UltraHLE, and Nesticle — but rebuilt for the AI era.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Tkinter-based Project64-style GUI**
- ✅ **Plug-in Loader System**
- ✅ **Hex Viewer + Disassembler (Inspector EmuAI)**

- ✅ **ROM Loader (Stubbed)**
- ✅ **Threaded Execution Ready**

🧠 EmuAI Lore Integration
“We need something different.” - King Samalotte, 20XX

All code within agiemulator0x is infused with EmulAI Mythos, an evolving in-universe emulator framework built on Flame64’s sentient runtime architecture. Expect AI modules, randomizers, surreal debug experiences, and more.
